`HiSPoD <https://github.com/HiSPoD/HiSPoD>`_ is a MatlabÂ® 
program developed for simulating and analyzing undulator 
white-beam diffraction patterns from polycrystalline samples.

We kindly request that you cite :cite:`cite:01` if you use *HiSPoD*.

Features
--------

* Simulate diffraction pattern of a given material.
* Calculated radially averaged 1D diffraction profile from 2D diffraction data from the Advanced Photon Source beamline 32-ID-B.
* Index (hkl) of diffraction data.
