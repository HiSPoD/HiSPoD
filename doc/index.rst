`HiSPoD <https://github.com/decarlof/HiSPoD>`_ is developed for polychromatic 
x-ray diffraction of polycrystalline samples. 

We kindly request that you cite the following article :cite:`cite:01` 
if you use HiSPoD.

HiSPoD documentation is at `url <http://hispod.readthedocs.org/>`_.

Features
--------

* Simulate diffraction pattern of a given material.
* Calculated radially averaged 1D diffraction profile from 2D diffraction data from the Advanced Photon Source beamline 32-ID-B.
* Index (hkl) of diffraction data.
