abstract = {A high-speed X-ray diffraction technique was recently developed at the 32-ID-B beamline of the Advanced Photon Source for studying highly dynamic, yet non-repeatable and irreversible, materials processes. In experiments, the microstructure evolution in a single material event is probed by recording a series of diffraction patterns with extremely short exposure time and high frame rate. Owing to the limited flux in a short pulse and the polychromatic nature of the incident X-rays, analysis of the diffraction data is challenging. Here, {\it HiSPoD}, a stand-alone Matlab-based software for analyzing the polychromatic X-ray diffraction data from polycrystalline samples, is described. With {\it HiSPoD}, researchers are able to perform diffraction peak indexing, extraction of one-dimensional intensity profiles by integrating a two-dimensional diffraction pattern, and, more importantly, quantitative numerical simulations to obtain precise sample structure information.},

abstract = {Using a high-speed camera and an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD), a simultaneous X-ray imaging and diffraction technique has been developed for studying dynamic material behaviors during high-rate tensile loading. A Kolsky tension bar has been used to pull samples at 1000s${\sp {$-$}1}$ and 5000s${\sp {$-$}1}$ strain-rates for super-elastic equiatomic NiTi and 1100-O series aluminium, respectively. By altering the ICCD gating time, temporal resolutions of 100ps and 3.37{$\mu$}s have been achieved in capturing the diffraction patterns of interest, thus equating to single-pulse and 22-pulse X-ray exposure. Furthermore, the sample through-thickness deformation process has been simultaneously imaged {\it via} phase-contrast imaging. It is also shown that adequate signal-to-noise ratios are achieved for the detected white-beam diffraction patterns, thereby allowing sufficient information to perform quantitative data analysis diffraction {\it via} in-house software ({\it WBXRD_GUI}). Of current interest is the ability to evaluate crystal {\it d}-spacing, texture evolution and material phase transitions, all of which will be established from experiments performed at the aforementioned elevated strain-rates.},

Characterizing the dynamics using conventional laser optical techniques have been difficult in the near-nozzle region where the fuel jet, ligaments, and droplets interact with visible light strongly producing severe multiple scattering and optical opacity. Here, we use a novel technique to characterize the velocity and turbulence intensity fields of the high-speed diesel sprays in the near-field by multi-exposed X-ray phase-contrast images. With the X-ray-imaging data, the effects of the orifice inlet geometry and injection pressure on the near-field dynamics of the diesel sprays are investigated. Notable features of the spray dynamics in the near-nozzle region and beyond are discussed by comparing the measurement results with the predictions of conventional gas jet theories. "

High speed X-ray phase contrast imaging (PCI) was utilized to study the damage mechanisms in dry and wet sand particles under dynamic compressive loading. A modified Kolsky bar setup was used to apply controlled dynamic compression on two contacting sand particles. Pulverization was observed as the sole mode of failure for dry sand particles. Under wet conditions, one of the particles was observed to break into large sub-particles which pulverized upon further loading. 3-D X-ray tomography was used to assess the failure of sand particles under static compressive loading. Breaking into large sub-particles followed by pulverization was observed under static compressive loading. The order of pulverization for the particles was observed to be random in all experiments.

abstract = {Fracture and breakage of single crystals, particularly of silicon wafers, are multi-scale problems: the crack tip starts propagating on an atomic scale with the breaking of chemical bonds, forms crack fronts through the crystal on the micrometre scale and ends macroscopically in catastrophic wafer shattering. Total wafer breakage is a severe problem for the semiconductor industry, not only during handling but also during temperature treatments, leading to million-dollar costs per annum in a device production line. Knowledge of the relevant dynamics governing perfect cleavage along the {111} or {110} faces, and of the deflection into higher indexed {{\it hkl}} faces of higher energy, is scarce due to the high velocity of the process. Imaging techniques are commonly limited to depicting only the state of a wafer before the crack and in the final state. This paper presents, for the first time, {\it in situ} high-speed crack propagation under thermal stress, imaged simultaneously in direct transmission and diffraction X-ray imaging. It shows how the propagating crack tip and the related strain field can be tracked in the phase-contrast and diffracted images, respectively. Movies with a time resolution of microseconds per frame reveal that the strain and crack tip do not propagate continuously or at a constant speed. Jumps in the crack tip position indicate pinning of the crack tip for about 1{--}2ms followed by jumps faster than 2{--}6ms${\sp {$-$}1}$, leading to a macroscopically observed average velocity of 0.028{--}0.055ms${\sp {$-$}1}$. The presented results also give a proof of concept that the described X-ray technique is compatible with studying ultra-fast cracks up to the speed of sound.},

This work is an investigation of several nano-Al based thermites subjected to very rapid heating rates. The ignition temperature of thermites, as measured by the onset of optical emission, was measured using a rapidly heated Pt wire. Generally, ignition was seen to occur above the melting temperature of aluminum. The exception was Al/Bi2O3 which ignited slightly below this point. Samples were also rapidly heated in situ within electron microscopes to provide direct imaging before and after heating. The sintering of aggregated and/or agglomerated particles into characteristically larger structures was experimentally observed in all cases, and the fuel and oxidizer were found to be in surface contact suggesting that a condensed-phase reactive sintering mechanism had occurred. High resolution image sequences of thermites ignited on the Pt wire were collected using a real time phase contrast imaging technique at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Lab. The results suggest that reactive sintering occurs on a fast timescale, and relatively early in the reaction, leading to rapid melting and coalescence of aggregated particles. This dramatically changes the initial size and morphology of the constituents before the remainder of the material burns. The results question the idea that a decrease in particle size will necessarily lead to an enhancement in reactivity, since large amounts of sintering occurs early in the reaction, and alters the morphology. It is suggested that improvements in reactivity can be achieved by designing architectures to improve the interfacial contact upon sintering, as well as by selecting oxidizers based on their ability to liberate and transport oxygen in the condensed phase, while producing volatile species to assist in convective energy transport.
