abstract = {A high-speed X-ray diffraction technique was recently developed at the 32-ID-B beamline of the Advanced Photon Source for studying highly dynamic, yet non-repeatable and irreversible, materials processes. In experiments, the microstructure evolution in a single material event is probed by recording a series of diffraction patterns with extremely short exposure time and high frame rate. Owing to the limited flux in a short pulse and the polychromatic nature of the incident X-rays, analysis of the diffraction data is challenging. Here, {\it HiSPoD}, a stand-alone Matlab-based software for analyzing the polychromatic X-ray diffraction data from polycrystalline samples, is described. With {\it HiSPoD}, researchers are able to perform diffraction peak indexing, extraction of one-dimensional intensity profiles by integrating a two-dimensional diffraction pattern, and, more importantly, quantitative numerical simulations to obtain precise sample structure information.},
