Experiment geometry===================*HiSPoD* works for both reflection and transmission geometries, as shownin Fig. 2. For polycrystalline samples, these two geometries arefundamentally the same, and the only difference is that in transmissiongeometry, the energy spectrum will be modified due to the sampleabsorption. Usually, the lower the energy, the higher the intensityattenuation is. The exceptions occur at the sample absorption edges,which are normally lower than the 1\ :sup:`st` harmonic energy andthereby can be ignored most of the time. A function called “Loadabsorption file” can be used for taking into account the absorptioneffect of the sample when quantitative simulation is desired. Detailswill be introduced in following sections.|image1|Figure 2: Reflection and transmission experiment geometriesIn the experiment, the detector is placed with detection planeperpendicular to the ground, as shown in Fig. 3. The position of thedetector could be rather arbitrary. It’s recommended that the detectoris mounted and moved in the “Circular track” geometry, such as the caseof mounting the detector on a diffractometer arm for the ease of gettingthe direct beam X and Y values.|image2|Figure 3: Position of the detector
