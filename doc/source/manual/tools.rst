The experiment   parameters and sample structure won’t be affected.-  Copy results: transfer all the data into the current workspace of   Matlab® as *udata*. For example, the 1D intensity will be   *udata.Ith*, and the angle will be *udata.th*. The simulated   intensity will be *udata. Ith\_fit\_final.*-  Save results: save all the data to the hard drive.-  Close all figures: close all the figures displayed. A quick desktop   clean-up function.-  Quit program: exit the program and close the control panel.
